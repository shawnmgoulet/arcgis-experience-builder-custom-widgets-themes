  "description": "This is a copy of the simple widget included in the `./client/your-extensions` directory of the developer edition of ArcGIS Experience Builder. It includes an example of how to use the config file, and it includes a placeholder SVG icon. It intentionally does not include the following so you can use this to start from scratch: i18n translations, a Settings panel, unit tests. See the documentation for more information on how to implement these features.",
